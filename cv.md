### About Me
 At May of 2023 i quitted my previous job and started the big way of searching myself. My husband adviced me to try front-end development, thinkinkg i'd like it. So it was.

 
 One of my strengths is a soft skills. I worked a cabin attendant for 4.5 years, so i can find a to a person in different situations.
 Also i like studying and sure that it's really important for everyone regardless of profession.


 I want to be useful for the product in wich i work and make the process of using it by customers more easier as much as it possible.
